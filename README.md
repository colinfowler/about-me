# Greeting
Hello, anyone who has found their way to my Git page!

I am currently a student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. My first two years were spent as a Physics major with a Mathematics minor (acquired at the end of my 2nd year), however the remaining three are seeing a change to a Computer Science/Software Engineering major/concentration with a Mathematics minor. Below, you can find the entirety of my academic courseload, which will be updated as they are completed.
